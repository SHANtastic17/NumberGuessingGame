# NumberGuessingGame
## ABSTRACT
The Java number guessing game demonstrates programming skills with difficulty levels, time limits, and hints. Emphasizing input validation, concurrency, and exception handling, it provides a stable experience, highlighting the creativity and joy of coding.
The Game challenges players to guess a secret number with multiple difficulty levels, time limits, and a hint system. This interactive game aims to enhance the userâ€™s deductive skills in an engaging way.
It is a console-based number guessing game designed to entertain and challenge players of varying skill levels. The game offers three distinct difficulty levels - Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with its own range of numbers and time limits. Players are prompted to guess a randomly generated secret number within the specified range, with the objective of correctly identifying it within the allotted time.
### Key Features:
1.	Multiple Difficulty Levels: Players can choose from three difficulty levels - Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level presents different ranges of numbers and time limits, catering to players with varying levels of experience and skill.
2.	Interactive Gameplay: The game engages players through an interactive console interface. Players input their guesses using the keyboard and receive immediate feedback based on their guesses and the game's rules.
3.	Time Limit: To add a sense of urgency and challenge, each guessing attempt is subject to a time limit. If the player fails to guess the number within the specified time, they lose the game.
4.	Hint System: Depending on the selected difficulty level, players may receive hints to aid them in their guessing. These hints provide directional guidance to help players narrow down their guesses and increase their chances of success.
5.	Play Again Option: Upon completing a game, players are given the option to play again. This feature enhances replayability and encourages continued engagement with the game.
### Technical Implementation:
The game is implemented using Java programming language and utilizes various language features and libraries to achieve its functionality. It employs enums to define the different difficulty levels and encapsulates related properties such as minimum and maximum numbers, time limits, and hint availability.
The core gameplay logic is encapsulated within the guessNumber() method, which handles the generation of secret numbers, user input, feedback generation, and game outcome determination. Additionally, the chooseLevel() method prompts users to select a difficulty level before initiating gameplay.
Concurrency is employed to enforce time limits on user input, ensuring that the game remains responsive and adheres to the specified time constraints. The ExecutorService and Future classes from the java.util.concurrent package facilitate this functionality.
### Concurrency Management:
Concurrency is employed to enforce time limits on user input, ensuring that the game remains responsive and adheres to the specified time constraints. The ExecutorService and Future classes from the java.util.concurrent package facilitate this functionality.
### Input Validation:
The game incorporates input validation to ensure that player guesses are within the specified range for each difficulty level. This prevents invalid guesses and maintains the integrity of the gameplay experience.
### Exception Handling:
Robust exception handling mechanisms are implemented to gracefully manage potential errors or interruptions during gameplay, such as timeout exceptions or unexpected input. This enhances the stability and reliability of the game.
### User Interaction:
The game fosters user engagement through clear prompts, informative feedback, and intuitive gameplay mechanics. This ensures a seamless and enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels.
## INTRODUCTION
The number guessing game project presented herein offers an engaging and interactive gaming experience designed to entertain and challenge players of all skill levels. In this digital era, where gaming has become an integral part of leisure activities, this project seeks to provide a unique and enjoyable gaming experience through a console-based application.
The concept of the game is simple yet intriguing: players are tasked with guessing a randomly generated secret number within a specified range, with the goal of correctly identifying it within a limited time frame. To enhance the gaming experience, the project incorporates multiple difficulty levels - Easy, Medium, and Hard - each offering its own set of challenges and opportunities for players to test their deductive skills.
Through this project, we aim to showcase the practical application of core programming concepts and techniques, such as object-oriented programming, enum usage, input validation, concurrency management, and exception handling. By delving into the technical implementation of the game, we offer insights into how these concepts can be effectively utilized to develop robust and engaging software applications.
In the subsequent sections of this report, we will delve deeper into the technical details of the project, exploring its implementation, features, and functionality. Additionally, we will discuss the challenges encountered during the development process and reflect on the lessons learned. Overall, this project serves as a testament to the creative potential of programming and the joy of gaming.
## FUNCTIONALITY BREAKDOWN
The functionality of the Java-based number guessing game can be dissected into various components, each contributing to the overall gaming experience:
1.	User Interface Interaction: The game engages players through a text-based interface, prompting them to input their guesses for the secret number. This interaction is facilitated by the Scanner class in Java, allowing seamless communication between the player and the game.
2.	Random Number Generation: At the onset of each game session, a secret number is generated randomly within the predefined range for the selected difficulty level. This ensures unpredictability and adds an element of challenge to the gameplay.
3.	Guess Validation: Player inputs are rigorously validated to ensure they fall within the acceptable range for the chosen difficulty level. Any guesses outside this range prompt the game to provide corrective feedback, maintaining the integrity of the gaming experience.
4.	Time Constraint Management: The game imposes a time limit on each guessing attempt, enhancing the sense of urgency and excitement. Time management techniques are implemented to enforce these constraints, ensuring fair gameplay while preventing indefinite delays.
5.	Feedback Delivery: Immediate feedback is provided to players after each guess, indicating whether their guess was correct or incorrect. Additionally, if the guess is incorrect, the game may offer hints or directional guidance to assist players in their subsequent attempts.
6.	Game Outcome Determination: The game logic evaluates each guess to determine whether it matches the secret number. If a player successfully guesses the number within the allotted time, they win the game; otherwise, they lose. This outcome is communicated clearly to the player, along with an option to play again.
7.	Exception Handling: Robust exception handling mechanisms are in place to gracefully manage unexpected errors or interruptions during gameplay.
By breaking down the functionality of the number guessing game into these key components, players can gain a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in its design and implementation.
